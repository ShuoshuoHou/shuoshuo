#abstract = "We propose a generalized focal loss function based on the Tversky index to address the issue of data imbalance in medical image segmentation. Compared to the commonly used Dice loss, our loss function achieves a better trade off between precision and recall when training on small structures such as lesions. To evaluate our loss function, we improve the attention U-Net model by incorporating an image pyramid to preserve contextual features. We experiment on the BUS 2017 dataset and ISIC 2018 dataset where lesions occupy 4.84% and 21.4% of the images area and improve segmentation accuracy when compared to the standard U-Net by 25.7% and 3.6%, respectively."

abstract = "The recent global financial crisis highlighted the link between financial market and the whole real economy. In this paper, 
I document that domestic loans are countercyclical to GDP in China. Then I use a standard real business cycle (RBC) model that includes
the debt and equity financed by firms to explore how real economy variables are affected by financial shocks. 
My analysis shows that financial shocks explain about 66 percent of GDP fluctuations. Therefore, financial frictions are the main 
driving force of macroeconomic fluctuations in China through the real economic factor of labor. "
