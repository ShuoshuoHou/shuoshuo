#abstract = "We propose a generalized focal loss function based on the Tversky index to address the issue of data imbalance in medical image segmentation. Compared to the commonly used Dice loss, our loss function achieves a better trade off between precision and recall when training on small structures such as lesions. To evaluate our loss function, we improve the attention U-Net model by incorporating an image pyramid to preserve contextual features. We experiment on the BUS 2017 dataset and ISIC 2018 dataset where lesions occupy 4.84% and 21.4% of the images area and improve segmentation accuracy when compared to the standard U-Net by 25.7% and 3.6%, respectively."

abstract = "This paper evaluates quantitatively how sector-specific productivity shocks propagate through heterogenous production networks and generate distinct aggregate fluctuations in the U.S. economy. I document a set of facts showing the changing nature of the input-output network structure. Industries in the U.S. economy tend to be linked by a few central sectors, like the Finance & Insurance, over time. In particular, such an economy is associated with lower GDP growth and lower GDP volatility. Guided by these facts, I propose a general equilibrium model with exogenous production networks. To emphasize the importance of input-output network structure, I estimate the macroeconomic impact of sector-specific productivity shocks up to a second-order approximation where network structure is one of the key determinants. With heterogenous input-output networks structures, the nonlinear aggregate impact of sectoral TFP shocks are different substantially. Furthermore, model-simulated GDP growth volatility declines as industries centrality levels (the importance of an industry as an input-supplier in the economy) getting more dispersive, which is consistent with the empirical findings.
